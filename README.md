**An interactive web app for studying and quizzing yourself on the 20 common amino acids. Perfect for students of biochemistry, molecular biology, and anyone else wanting to learn the names and properties of the amino acids.**

This application provides a clean, user-friendly interface to learn amino acid names, structures, properties, and structural affinities.

**[Live Demo](https://semvdn.github.io/AA_Quiz/)** ðŸ‘ˆ

## Features

-   **ðŸ“š Study Mode:** A scrollable deck of all 20 amino acids. Each card displays:
    -   Full Name, 3-Letter Code, and 1-Letter Code
    -   High-quality 2D Structure Image
    -   Key Properties (e.g., Polar, Aromatic, Charged)
    -   Sheet and Turn Affinity data

-   **ðŸ§  Dynamic Quiz Engine:** Test your knowledge with a powerful and customizable quiz generator.
    -   **Multiple Game Modes:**
        -   *Properties to Name:* Guess the amino acid from its properties.
        -   *Name to Properties:* Identify the correct properties for a given amino acid.
        -   *Name to Affinity:* Match an amino acid to its structural affinities.
        -   *Shuffle Mode:* A random mix of all question types for a comprehensive review.
    -   **Customizable Sessions:**
        -   Select specific amino acids to focus on (e.g., only polar, nonpolar, or charged).
        -   Set the number of repetitions for each amino acid.
        -   Toggle an option to repeat incorrectly answered questions until you get them right.
    -   **Smart Hints:** A "Show Structure" hint is available when quizzing from name to properties/affinity.

-   **ðŸ“ˆ Instant Feedback & Report Card:**
    -   Get immediate visual feedback on your multiple-choice answers.
    -   At the end of each session, receive a detailed "Report Card" modal with:
        -   Overall Grade (A+, B, etc.)
        -   Accuracy Percentage
        -   Total Time
        -   Best Streak
        -   A list of amino acids you've mastered and those that need more practice.

-   **ðŸ“± Fully Responsive:** The interface is designed to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
